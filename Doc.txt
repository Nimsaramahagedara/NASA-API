Challenges faced
1.Rate Limits and Throttling: 
 APIs enforce rate limits and throttling to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. 
 Exceeding these limits can lead to temporary blocks or degraded service.
2.Testing and Debugging
Initializing a testing library with the vite is somewhat challenging, 
and i was able to integrate it with the vitetest testing library
